About:-

This MPIApp defines the possible structure of communication interface that could be used by BrainHarmonics to pass spikes between neurons.

The file include/CommIntf.h defines an abstract base class which defines the methods to be implemented by underlying communication modes i.e MPI or MP
The file include/MpiComm.h implements the methods inherited from CommIntf.h to handle MPI communication mode
Implementor of MP needs to create a new file under include/ and inherit the baseclass CommIntf.h to implement the virtual methods to handle MP specific communication


Build Instructions:-

1) mkdir MpiApp/build
2) cd build
3) cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpic++ ../  (ensure mpic++ and related mpi tools are installed and the path set in $PATH variable)
4) make
5) To run the app 
   mpirun -np 6 testMpi
